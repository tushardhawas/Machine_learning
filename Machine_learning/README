# Invisible Cloak Program

This Python program allows you to create the illusion of wearing an invisible cloak. You'll need to capture a background image and then use the program to make yourself appear "invisible" when wearing a black-colored cloak.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have the following:

- Python installed on your system.
- OpenCV library (usually installed using pip: `pip install opencv-python`).
- A webcam to capture images.

## Usage

1. **Capture a Background Image**:
   - Run the `capture_background.py` script. This script will capture the background image without you in it. You'll need to press the "q" key to save the background image.

2. **Run the Invisible Cloak Program**:
   - Run the `invisibleCloak.py` script. This script will use the captured background image and make anything black-colored (like a black cloak) appear as if it's invisible.

3. **Wear a Black-Colored Cloak**:
   - Make sure you're wearing a black-colored cloak or an object that is black.

4. **See the Magic Happen**:
   - Position yourself in front of your webcam with the black cloak on.
   - The program should now make the black-colored object appear invisible against the captured background image.

## Note

- Make sure your lighting conditions remain relatively consistent when capturing the background image and running the program to achieve the best effect.
- Experiment with the lighting and the position to achieve the best results.

Enjoy your invisible cloak illusion!
